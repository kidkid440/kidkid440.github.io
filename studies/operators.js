/*
* Operators:
*
* Java gives us many operators to change varibles. They can be broken up in this
* group.
*
*1.Assignment Operators which give values to the left of the operator based on 
*the value on the right.
*
*1a.The = sign is a simple assignment sign that assigns what value is on the right of 
*the sign to the left.  Ex.var arr = [];
*
*1b.the += Add and assignment operator takes the value on the right,adds it to the 
*left and the result is now the value for the left. Ex. c += b Same as (c = c + b).
*
*1c.The -= Subtract and assignment operator, subtracts what is on the right of the sign
*to the left and that is the new value for the left. Ex. (c -= b) Same as (c = c - b)
*
1d.The *= Multiply and assignment operator, multiplies the right of the sign to the left
* and that is the new value for the left. Ex (c *= b) Same as (c = c * b)
*
1e.the
